I am a second-year master's student in Computer Sciences at the University of Virginia(UVA). Before that, I worked in the industry for three years as a data analyst and engineering designer. At that time, I was also a team leader and managed a team of 10 people then. I obtained my bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering at Wuhan University of Technology(WHUT). I'm optimistic, humble, and curious about new knowledge. I love playing sports and photography.

My previous research experience included urban systems and large Language Models.

My long-term research interests lie in AI for social good, Computer vision, Large Language Models, HCI, and HRI. I'm trying to find some interdisciplinary research directions.

I'm actively applying for Ph.D. positions in 2025 Fall. Feel free to email me for academic cooperations or potential interviews.
